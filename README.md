## About this Project

The goal of this project is to create a web application that compares two Wikipedia articles, specifically focusing on the information within the info boxes. Users can input the subjects they want to compare, and the application will provide a detailed comparison of these two entities. It also offers additional information such as the number of words, number of views, etc., to help determine a "winner" between the two articles.

This project is developed by:

# V1 Basic Functionality

- Establishing the project design.
- Setting up a minimal functional architecture with a REST API.
- Enabling communication between container lists: PHP Server, WEB Server, MySQL Database.
- Implementing a slim framework with multiple routes.

# V2 Feature Implementation

### Comparative Display of Wiki Pages
- **Functionality:** Users enter two valid words matching Wikipedia titles to fetch info boxes for comparison.
- **Future Feature:** Implementing automatic word correction to prevent empty info boxes due to syntax errors.

### Search History
- **Description:** Unique to each user, available on the user's dashboard.

### Connection and Data Saving
- Saving data on the client side.

### Application Functionality Improvement
- Implementing HTTPS and developing redundancy, backup.

### Additional Notes (v2)
- **Usage of Comparative Display:** Access `/compare/?search=word1,word2,word3` for JSON formatted infoboxes.
- **HTTPS Implementation:** Completed.
- **Load Balancing:** Under development.

# V3 Feature Implementation

Final version with enhanced features:


+Ease of Deployment
Streamlining setup processes.
Creation of a setup.sh file.

+Intuitive interface for system management and monitoring

+user statistics

+create a user and define their password

+delete users and change ro
